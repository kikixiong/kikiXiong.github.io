I am a final-year dual-degree undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence at South China Normal University and University of Aberdeen, with a minor in Applied Psychology. Beginning in Fall 2025, I will pursue my MSc in Social Data Science at the University of Oxford, seeking to synergize algorithmic innovation with societal applications.
