I am a final-year dual-degree undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence at South China Normal University and University of Aberdeen, with a minor in Applied Psychology. Beginning in Fall 2025, I will pursue my MSc in Social Data Science at the University of Oxford, seeking to synergize algorithmic innovation with societal applications.

My research navigates two frontiers:

Decoding Biological Complexity - Developed cross-attention graph neural networks (GNNs) for gene regulatory network inference (published at ICAML 2024 & arXiv), and currently pretrain genomic foundation models at HKUST(GZ) to map genetic variations.

Engineering Intelligent Systems - Created adaptive navigation algorithms using deep reinforcement learning, and built award-winning AI platforms integrating LLMs (e.g. 1st Prize in Guangdong AI Competition) for historical education and precision agriculture.

Recognized with 10+ national/international honors including Mathematical Contest in Modeling awards and Challenge Cup medals, I also implement AI solutions in fintech through Innovus Capital internships. My upcoming Oxford journey will focus on developing causal inference frameworks for behavioral prediction using multimodal social data.
